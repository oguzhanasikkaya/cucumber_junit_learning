-MVP: MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT

-DDT: DATA DRIVEN TESTING FRAME WORK
    >Data Driven Testing: Execute the same test against different test daya
    >Data Driven Testing Framework: is the framework we are able to read data
     from external file and use it in our source code.
    >We can get the daya from:
        >MS Excel
        >Ms Access
        >Database
        >Features files
        >Configuration.properties
-Keyword Driven Testing:
    >Creating testing structure based on some keywords that are executable.
    >This requires a lot of time to invest in to even make it work, but also
        it is hard to maintain,and hard to scale since the object repository,
        and keyword repository have to me maintained and expanded as the framework
        gets bigger.
-TDD  : TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT(BUG FREE DEVELOPMENT)
    >There is a repeating development  cycle with TDD
        1-Write tests before writing any source code.
        2-Run the tests, and tests will fail
        3-Write minimum amount of code to make the tests pass
        4-Run the tests, and tests will pass.
        5-REFACTOR AND REPEAT
